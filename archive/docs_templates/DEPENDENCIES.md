# Dependency Mapping (Approach)

Define how the project should map and surface dependencies.

## Dependency Types
- Skill/level requirements
- Task prerequisites
- Item requirements
- Location access requirements

## Output Style
- Shortest unlock path
- Alternative routes when options exist
- Required items and where to obtain them

## Data Plan
- Store dependency data in `data/reference.json`.
