# RL Gamified Advanced Test

Mission Learning Statement
- Mission: Build a gamified reinforcement learning testbed with emulator-driven agents.
- Learning focus: RL environment design, reward shaping, OCR/vision integration, and control loops.
- Project start date: 2026-01-15 (inferred from earliest git commit)

## Overview
This project is an emulator-driven RL sandbox that combines vision, input control, and episodic evaluation to test agent behaviors in a constrained environment.

Quickstart:
- CLI: `python run_app.py status`
- GUI: `python run_app.py gui`

RL:
- See `pokemon_crystal_rl/README.md` (internal)

## Metadata
- Completeness: 60%
- Known issues: Training/reward values need tuning; core system functional
