# RL Gamified Advanced Test

## What It Is

Start 2026-01-15 — Emulator-driven RL lab with OCR/vision, control loops, and reward shaping. Full environment interface, action abstraction, and telemetry for rapid iteration. Built to validate agent behaviors, stabilize training loops, and prove applied RL engineering under constraints.

The system hunts long-tail mispricings, executes two-leg trades with strict risk controls, and proves positive EV through auditable logs and iteration. No LLMs in the hot path.## How It Works- See README sections below for details on components and flow.## What It IsStart 2026-01-15 — Emulator-driven RL lab with OCR/vision, control loops, and reward shaping.

## Overview
This project is an emulator-driven RL sandbox that combines vision, input control, and episodic evaluation to test agent behaviors in a constrained environment.

Quickstart:
- CLI: `python run_app.py status`
- GUI: `python run_app.py gui`

RL:
- See `pokemon_crystal_rl/README.md` (internal)

## Metadata
- Completeness: 60%
- Known issues: Training/reward values need tuning; core system functional
